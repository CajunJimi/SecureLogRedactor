### Known Edge Cases and Solutions

#### 1. Large File Processing
- **Issue**: Processing large files may cause browser to become unresponsive
- **Resolution**: 
  - Implemented chunked processing
  - Added 10MB file size limit
  - Added progress bar for visual feedback
- **Outcome**: Improved handling of large files without UI freezing

#### 2. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Potential memory leaks from storing large undo/redo history
- **Resolution**:
  - Implemented text state tracking
  - Clear redo stack when new changes are made

- **Outcome**: Better memory management for long sessions

#### 3. Regular Expression Performance
- **Issue**: Regex patterns being recompiled on every text processing
- **Resolution**:
  - Cached all regex patterns
  - Optimized patterns for better performance
  - Added pattern testing for edge cases
- **Outcome**: Improved processing speed and reliability

#### 4. Browser Compatibility
- **Issue**: Some features may not work in older browsers
- **Resolution**:
  - Added checks for API availability
  - Used standardized CSS properties
  - Implemented fallbacks where necessary
- **Outcome**: Better cross-browser compatibility

### Debugging Tips
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify localStorage availability for preferences
3. Monitor memory usage during large file processing
4. Test regex patterns with various input formats

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch for UI responsiveness during chunk processing
- Monitor memory usage with large files
- Track processing time for different file sizes
- Verify preference saving/loading speed
